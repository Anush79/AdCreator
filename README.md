# React Web Application Assignment

This repository contains the source code and files for a React web application assignment completed by Anushka Jaiswal. The assignment was given by Keywordio and consists of building a responsive web application with specific features and functionality.

## Assignment Details

The assignment included the following requirements and features:

- Create a responsive web application using React JS.
- Implement a top navigation bar with "Dashboard" and "Create Ad" links.
- Add sorting options to tables for sorting by "High to Low" and "Low to High."
- Create a toggle for Ads Insights, which displays a doughnut chart and table.
- Implement a dropdown for matrices in Ads Insights, allowing users to select a metric to display in the doughnut chart.
- Based on checkboxes (Text Ad and/or Media Ad), redirect to the Fill Data page and show respective input fields.
- After submitting the form, redirect to "Ads Submitted," wait for 0.6 seconds, and redirect to the "Create Ads" page.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- [src/](src/) - Contains the source code for the React application.
  - [components/](src/components/) - Contains React components used in the application.
  - [App.js](src/App.js) - The main application component.
- [public/](public/) - Contains public assets, including the HTML template.
- [README.md](README.md) - This readme file.

## Getting Started

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
